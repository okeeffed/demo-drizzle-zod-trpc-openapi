# Upgrade path

This isn't directly relevant feedback for the PR, but following up for anyone curious and using `trpc@next` for the v11 releases. These are the steps I took to patch this in:

Checkout this branch e.g. clone the repo git clone https://github.com/jlalmes/trpc-openapi, changing into this branch git checkout lucasthevenet:master.

I had to manually update getProcedureType within src/utils/procedure.ts. Not quite sure, but think this is v11 specific. I also just hacked the TS and ESLint ignores here.

const getProcedureType = (procedure: OpenApiProcedure): ProcedureType => {
if (procedure.\_def.query) return 'query';
if (procedure.\_def.mutation) return 'mutation';
if (procedure.\_def.subscription) return 'subscription';
// @ts-expect-error: looks to be something from v11
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return
if (procedure.\_def.type) return procedure.\_def.type;
throw new Error('Unknown procedure type');
};
Ensure deps are installed. It's using package-lock.json so I used npm install.
Build from source with npm run build.
Patch the package with the output. I am using pnpm in the repo I am patching the package for, so I ended up running pnpm patch trpc-openapi. If you follow the steps for pnpm patch, then you effectively just replace the dist folder in the patch with the output dist folder with the changes that we did above. I'm not actually 100% sure how this is done with yarn and npm these days but I used to use patch-package.
It was all happy days for me after this (obviously be aware of any other potential breaking changes for v11 as this was me hacking around a spike on alpha). Thanks @lucasthevenet for the PR.
